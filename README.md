# Android-chatbot
we define an API endpoint for the chatbot and use Flask to create a server that listens for incoming requests. When a request is received, we use the Dialogflow Python client to process the user's input and extract the intent and parameters. We then call the appropriate function based on the intent and parameters, which returns a response that is sent back to the user.
